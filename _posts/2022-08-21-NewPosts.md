# Documentation: Create A Post Via Jekyll Theme
## This documentation covers the basics of creating a new post from within this project. It also contains examples of markdown language used to create future posts.
---
New posts are added to the _posts folder, and should be a .md filetype (for markdown). <br><strong>You must name the file with a specific format: YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md. Failure to follow this format will result in posts not showing up!</strong> <br> All posts require header information:

## Common HTML Elements
Traditional H1-H6 elements are created using the # symbol.
Example:

# \# -> \<h1>
##\## -> \<h2>
### \### -> \<h3>
#### \#### -> \<h4>
##### \##### -> \<h5>
###### \###### -> \<h6>

**You'll notice the H1 also adds in a horizontal rule element.

An unordered list is added with * characters:

* one
* two
* three

## Inserting Code Blocks
Inserting a code block is very useful, and is done between sets of three ticks:
<br>
\```[language-here] <br>
[code goes here] <br>
\``` <br>

Example: (javascript noted as lange, and the code is as shown)
```javascript
console.log('hello world!');
```
 
Some C#:
```c#
int x = 5;
int y = 10;

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++>)
{
    Console.WriteLine(x+y);
    x++;
    y++;
}
```

## Images
 
Imbed images using a ![img-description] tag followed by an (image url) and an image description \_Like This_ <br>
### Example:

\!\[heterochromia-cat](https://www.stockvault.net/data/2016/05/30/200848/preview16.jpg)Cat with heterochromatic eyes!

![heterochromia-cat](https://www.stockvault.net/data/2016/05/30/200848/preview16.jpg)Cat with heterochromatic eyes!

## Errors with theme not deploying properly
Run this locally: bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
Then commit changes to your remote repo. It should create a gh-pages branch automatically, and then you just set that as your GitHub page in the settings.
