# Picking A Demo Project

## The Situation:
You're looking for a job in technology, and want to impress a potential hiring manger/recruiter. Maybe you're partaking in a local coding bootcamp, and are expected to build and demo a project at the conclusion of your educational experience. <br>

While I am no expert on this matter, I have gone through the process myself. I decided to change careers at the age of 33. I pursed the self-taught route for over a year before taking part in a local bootcamp. I graduated from the Arkansas Coding Academy in October, 2021 and joined the Store Systems team at Dillard's a month later working as a full-stack developer.
