# Picking A Demo Project

## The Situation:
You're looking for a job in technology, and want to impress a potential hiring manger/recruiter. Maybe you're partaking in a local coding bootcamp, and are expected to build and demo a project at the conclusion of your educational experience. <br>

<strong>"What should a demo project look like? What should it include, and what should it be able to do?"</strong> <br>

First of all, I recommend anyone asking these questions to view this video by a bootcamp out of North Carolina, Coder Foundry: 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC483DTjRXU&ab_channel=CoderFoundry" target="_blank">The 1 Coding Project Idea Guaranteed To Get You A Software Development Job</a>

I agree whole-heartedly with what Bobby has to say in the video. Your project should:
* Use design patterns (such as MVC) to structure your project.
* Build a professional user interface/graphical user interface. A bootstrap template can really help you with this.
* Include a database, and implement all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).
* Include security by implementing authentication and authorization, and by avoiding common mistakes that can lead to SQL injection attacks along with other general security risks.
* Solve a business problem. The idea here is simple: build a project a hiring manager will recognize as something they use/have used professionally. If your application solves a business problem, then you will immediately appear more professional.

When I went through the Arkansas Coding Academy in 2021, I was tasked with creating a project for our demo day. I followed the above tips, and created an application that handled the customer and job tracking for a hypothetical jewelry store. Many/most/all companies have some way of tracking who their customers are, when they came in to have something done, what they paid, how long it took, etc. I solved this problem with my project choice.

Once you have a project idea in mind, you start the planning process and get things done. Keep in mind that building the project is just half the battle. You should fully understand every line of code in your project, and be able to explain what you did and why to a hiring manager. You never know what might come up in the interview! "On line 250 here you added this line of code. Why was that necessary?" Be ready for anything.
